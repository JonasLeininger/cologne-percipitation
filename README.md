# Analysis of percipitation in Cologne
Percipitation is the ammount of rain in a given time interval. The meteo stations measure percipitation in [mm/day]. This is equal to [liter/m^2] per day.

A notebook is available at [notebook](cologne_percipitation/notebooks/weather_cologne.ipynb).
Pictures are in the [data](data/) folder. Interessting are the videos made in [July 2021](data/Juli_2021/).

In general there is a clear causality between the ammount of percipitation, wet walls in the room and the follow up growth of mold.
